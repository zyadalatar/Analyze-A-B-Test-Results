# Analyze-A-B-Test-Results
One of Udacity's data analyst projects.For this project, was to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. The  goal was to work through the notebook to help the company understand if they should implement the new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.The result is that I don't find a sufficient evidence to suggest that the new page will have more conversions than the old page conversions.
